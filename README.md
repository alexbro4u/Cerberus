## Introduction

Cerberus is a powerful and flexible RBAC (Role-Based Access Control) authorization, access control, and authentication service. It empowers you to seamlessly manage user access to resources, enforce granular permissions, and safeguard your APIs with robust authentication mechanisms.

## Key Features

* **Granular RBAC Enforcement:** Define a comprehensive role hierarchy and assign roles to users, enabling fine-grained access control based on user permissions.

* **Secure Authentication:** Leverage multiple authentication methods, including JWTs, OAuth, and passwords, to verify user identities and restrict access accordingly.

* **User Group Management:** Create and manage user groups to efficiently organize users and assign permissions at the group level, streamlining access control for large user bases.

* **API Protection with JWTs:** Secure your APIs with JSON Web Tokens (JWTs), ensuring that only authorized users can access sensitive resources.

* **High Performance and Scalability:** Built on Go and gRPC, Cerberus delivers exceptional performance and scalability to handle even the most demanding workloads.

* **Ease of Use:** With its intuitive API and well-documented design, Cerberus is easy to integrate into your applications.

## Use Cases

Cerberus caters to a wide range of use cases, including:

* **Web Applications:** Protect user data and control access to web application features based on user roles and permissions.

* **Mobile Applications:** Implement secure authentication and authorization mechanisms for mobile apps, ensuring data integrity and user privacy.

* **APIs:** Safeguard APIs with robust authentication and fine-grained access control, preventing unauthorized access to sensitive data.

* **Microservices:** Enforce consistent access control policies across microservice architectures, enabling secure communication and collaboration between services.
